As the Social Media Coordinator for the international auction house Heritage Auctions, my work included creating and managing content for Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Pinterest, as well as generating reports on the success of these posts. In addition to writing engaging posts and creating graphics and collages to showcase the items from over 40 categories of products, I also managed a WordPress blog and edited content from company-wide contributors.
