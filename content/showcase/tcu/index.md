The marketing and communications of a university is a large and complicated task, and as the marketing and communications coordinator for the College of Fine Arts at Texas Christian University, I was responsible for managing internal and external marketing, as well as communications, for one of the busiest colleges on the TCU campus. This included writing feature stories and informational stories for the College of Fine Arts website; managing the College of Fine Arts social media and coordinating with internal department social media; managing advertising relationships with relevant publications; managing graphic design projects and the relationships between internal clients and the university graphic design team; maintaining a WordPress-backed website and updating content to WCAG 2.0 standards; and other duties as assigned.
